        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>I went for my first Piano lesson aged 7 and have always enjoyed music. To date, I have had experience playing three separate musical instruments. </p>

        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <p>I love preparing my own meals at home, and it's something I've got fairly good at. Apart from contributing to a healthier lifestyle, it's also great fun too!</p>

        <h3>Wordpress</h3>
        <p>Back in 2018, I gave myself a new challenge: learn to use Wordpress and build my own website. Trust me, I can't lie on this one... it <em>was</em> challenging initially (due to my inexperience) but I managed to plough through. Today, my blog is live on the internet and I've learned so much in the process. Nothing is ever perfect in the blogging world, so it's my goal to continually improve my skills and the website itself. </p>

        <h3>Canva</h3>
        <p>One skill I've managed to teach myself is how to use <a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva</a> for graphic designing. To put my skills to good use, I even joined my church E-team of which I'm now a member. There's nothing creative like designing Facebook or Instagram posts or mixing up crazy colours and images! </p>
